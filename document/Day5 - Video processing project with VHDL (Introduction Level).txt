Video processing in the Zybo board

I. Compare FPGA vs processor
	1. FPGA processing with VHDL
		- Low abstraction level video processing
		- High speed and parallel computing High frame rate and resolution possible
	2. Software processing with ARM processor
		- Low, mid or high abstraction level video processing
		- Processing speed limited by the processor and possible bottle neck on the processor low frame rate and resolution

II. Implementation
	1. Vivado block design
		- Dvi2rgb: conversion from the video input of the HDMI into 24-bits RGB video
		- Rgb2vga: converts the raw input video signal into VGA output
		- Processing_system7: Special block, contains the configuration of the processing system of the Zynq.
		- VideoProcessing: user customize
