7 Segment LED :

1. The Basys 3 FPGA has a clock source of 100MHz
	=> Calculate period time to refresh timer 20bit
Q/A: How to declare the frequence of clock signal?
	 Guess: Connect input clock in the constraint file to generate clock pulse
Q/A: "assign" mean "wiring"?
2. There are 2 timers use in this project:
	1. Timer to count 1 second
	2. Timer to count each 2.5(ms) to activate sequently LED
	*** Processing in parallel 「いいですね！」

HOW TO CONNECT THROUGH PMOD => just GPIO
