Step 1: Convert Image to hex file (cause Verilog can't read image file)
		(kodim123.bmp => kodim123.hex)
Step 2: Module for reading and processing image
		- note: Output is proceeded in 2 pixels in parallel : odd and even (to make faster)
		- Sequence: 
			+ Reading Data from input file
			+ Begin to read image file once reset was high by creating a starting pulse (start)
			+ State Transition (IDLE . VSYNC . HSYNC . DATA)
			+ Counting for time period of vsync, hsync, data processing
			+ Image Processing
Step 3: Writing BMP file
		- Define Header file
		- Convert data



Q/A:
1. Question: Blocking vs Non Blocking Assignment???
	Ans: - Blocking assigment 		: Use for combination logic (AND, OR, NOT)
	 	 - Non-blocking assignment  : Use for sequential logic - FlipFlop
2. Question : always @(*) ????
	Ans: Whenever inputs change
	always @(*) begin
	 ctrl_vsync_run = 0;
	 ctrl_hsync_run = 0;
	 ctrl_data_run  = 0;
	end
3. Question : how to declare the frequence of clock
4. Question : Do not understand HSYNC & VSYNC
5. Q: Why FPGA has accurate clock?
